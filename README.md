How I use the terminal to my advantage

compile the code
```bash
make build
```
this will automatically compile and run my binary

clean up my space
```bash
make clean
```
removes excess files created during testing

the script labeled "commit" is meant to do the job of make clean but in a more uniform fashion and also push all of my progress to the master branch

```bash
$~: commit
Message: <Some random commmit message>
```
